h1. Enspiral Vim Configuration

h2. The UNTESTED automatic installer... (check first, don't just trust me)

@wget http://github.com/enspiral/vim-config/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh@

h2. The manual way

1. Clone the repository
  
  @git://github.com/enspiral/vim-config.git ~/.vim@

2. Create a new vim config by copying the vim template we've provided.

  *NOTE*: If you already have a ~/.vimrc file, you should back it up. @cp ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.orig@ in case you want to go back to your original settings.

  @cp ~/.vim/templates/vimrc.template ~/.vimrc@

3. Start MacVim or GVim to see if it worked.

h3. Thanks to 

"Oh My Zsh":http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh as I just repurposed their script and file structure.
